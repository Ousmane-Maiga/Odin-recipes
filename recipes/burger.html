                      <p>Begin by proofing the yeast with some of the flour. 
                        Once the yeast is foamy, add the remaining flour, an egg, 
                        butter, sugar, and salt. Fit a stand mixer with a dough hook and knead the dough, 
                        scraping the sides often, until it's soft and sticky.</p>
                        <p>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and form into a smooth, 
                            round ball. Tuck the ends underneath and return the dough to an oil-drizzled stand mixer bowl. 
                            Ensure the dough is coated with oil, 
                            then cover and allow to rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size.</p>
                        <p>Transfer the dough back to the floured work surface. 
                            Pat into a slightly rounded rectangle, 
                            then cut into eight equal squares. Use your hands to shape and pat the squares into discs. 
                            Arrange the buns on a floured baking sheet, 
                            cover, and let rise until they've doubled in size.</p> 
                        <p>Brush the buns with an egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds. 
                            Bake in a preheated oven until lightly browned. Remove from the oven, 
                            allow the buns to cool, and slice in half lengthwise to serve.</p>

                        <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, 
                            and lightly oil the grate.</p>
                        <p>In a medium bowl, mix ground chuck, onion, 
                            brown sugar, Cajun seasoning, garlic powder, 
                            steak sauce, and bread crumbs. 
                            Form the mixture into 4 burger patties.</p>
                            <p>On the prepared grill, cook the burgers, 
                                3 to 5 minutes on each side,
                             or to desired doneness.</p>
